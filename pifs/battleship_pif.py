Welcome to {}'s Battleship PIF (managed by LatherBot).

I have placed my battleship somewhere on a 26x26 board.  Anyone with enough karma can take a shot. 
At the end of the PIF, I will reveal the location of my battleship and whoever was the first person 
to score a hit will be declared the winner.  If  nobody hits my battleship, then whoever came 
closest to hitting will be the be the winner.  

In order to qualify, you must have at least {} karma on the sub in the last 90 days. 

To enter, simply add a top-level comment on the PIF post that includes (on a line by itself) the command:

`LatherBot in <target coordinates>` where the target coordinates are a letter (A-Z) for the column 
then a blank space then a number (1-26) for the row.  Please format your entry correctly like so:

`LatherBot in A 3`

or

`LatherBot in C 1`

I will check your karma and record your entry if you qualify.

This PIF will close in {} hour(s).  At that time, I will reveal the location of my battleship and 
notify the PIF's creator.

LatherBot documentation can be found in [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/wiki/latherbot)

If you see something, say something: [Report PIF Abuse](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLVbYclUvKMbhrrz0WhfOKPQyr56_jH-4q8oOJf_emgAew7w/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Good luck!
