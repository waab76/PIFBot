Welcome to {}'s Pick-a-Number PIF (managed by LatherBot).

When the PIF ends, I'll choose a random number between {} and {}. Whoever guesses closest to 
that number will be the winner. If two entrants are the same distance away, the one who got 
closest without going over will win (Price Is Right tie-breaker).  In order to qualify, you must 
have at least {} karma on the sub in the last 90 days. 

To enter, simply add a top-level comment on the PIF post that includes (on a line by itself) the command:

`LatherBot IN <your guess>`
 
I will check your karma and record your guess if you qualify.  Example:

`LatherBot IN 23`

This PIF will close in {} hour(s). At that time, I will determine the winner and notify the PIF's creator.

LatherBot documentation can be found in [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/wiki/latherbot)

If you see something, say something: [Report PIF Abuse](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLVbYclUvKMbhrrz0WhfOKPQyr56_jH-4q8oOJf_emgAew7w/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Good luck!
